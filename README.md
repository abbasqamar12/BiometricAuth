# BiometricAuth App for Android

## Overview
This Android application provides secure biometric authentication for users, allowing them to access their accounts and sensitive data using their unique biometric features such as fingerprint, or face recognition. 

## Features
- Biometric authentication: Users can securely log in to the app using their biometric data, eliminating the need for passwords.
- Multi-biometric support: The app supports various biometric modalities including fingerprint, or face recognition, providing flexibility for users.
- Secure data storage: User data and biometric templates are securely stored on the device, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.
- Offline authentication: Biometric authentication can be performed offline without requiring an internet connection, enhancing usability and accessibility.
- Customizable UI: The user interface is customizable to match the branding and design requirements of different organizations or applications.

## Requirements
- Android device with biometric sensors (fingerprint scanner, facial recognition, iris scanner, etc.).
- Android API level 23 (Android 6.0 Marshmallow) or higher.
- Permissions for accessing biometric hardware and storage.

## Installation
1. Download the APK file from the provided link or build the app from the source code.
2. Enable installation from unknown sources in the device settings.
3. Install the APK file on the Android device.
4. Grant necessary permissions for biometric authentication and storage access.

## Usage
1. Launch the app on your Android device.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to enroll your biometric data (fingerprint, face, or iris).
3. Once enrolled, you can use biometric authentication to log in to the app securely.
4. In case of authentication failure or issues with biometric recognition, fallback to traditional authentication methods may be provided.
5. Ensure that biometric data is stored securely on the device and encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Considerations
- Biometric data should be securely stored and encrypted to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms in case of biometric authentication failures.
- Regularly update the app to patch security vulnerabilities and improve performance.
- Educate users about the importance of protecting their biometric data and the risks associated with biometric authentication.
